/**
 * Challenge 1: Given the following illustrations, identify each tree as:
- Tree
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Not Applicable

Challenge 2: Create 3 methods that are:
• insert (inserts a node as a child of the given parent node)
• find (retrieves a given node)
• contains (returns a Boolean if a given node exists)

Challenge 3: Create 1 additional method that is:
• remove (removes a node and its children from the BST)
